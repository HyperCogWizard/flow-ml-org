# Financial Accounts as Tensor Structures

This implementation demonstrates how to model financial accounts through tensor embeddings using the GGML cognitive tensor infrastructure. The system encodes financial account relationships into high-dimensional tensor space where similarity becomes distance and transaction patterns form recognizable geometric structures.

## Core Architecture

### Account Tensor Embeddings

Financial accounts are represented as points in multi-dimensional tensor space with three primary embedding layers:

1. **Primary Embeddings** (64 dimensions): Core account identity and characteristics
2. **Temporal Embeddings** (12 dimensions): Time-based transaction patterns  
3. **Behavioral Embeddings** (32 dimensions): Usage patterns and behavioral signatures

### Prime-Based Account Type Encoding

Account types use prime number dimensions to ensure non-interference:

- **Checking Accounts**: Prime dimension 2 (binary states)
- **Savings Accounts**: Prime dimension 3 (ternary activity levels)
- **Credit Accounts**: Prime dimension 5 (five utilization levels)
- **Investment Accounts**: Prime dimension 7 (seven risk categories)
- **Business Accounts**: Prime dimension 11 (complexity levels)
- **Shell Companies**: Prime dimension 13 (shell indicators)

### Financial Tensor Operations

```c
// Initialize financial tensor system
ggml_financial_tensor_system_t* system = ggml_financial_tensor_system_init(ctx, 1000, 10000);

// Add accounts with different types
uint32_t checking = ggml_financial_add_account(system, ctx, GGML_ACCOUNT_CHECKING, 1000.0f);
uint32_t business = ggml_financial_add_account(system, ctx, GGML_ACCOUNT_BUSINESS, 50000.0f);
uint32_t shell = ggml_financial_add_account(system, ctx, GGML_ACCOUNT_SHELL, 0.0f);

// Process transactions
ggml_financial_add_transaction(system, ctx, business, shell, GGML_TRANSACTION_WIRE, 100000.0f);
ggml_financial_add_transaction(system, ctx, shell, checking, GGML_TRANSACTION_TRANSFER, 9800.0f);

// Compute account similarity (cosine distance in tensor space)
float similarity = ggml_financial_account_similarity(system, checking, business);

// Detect suspicious patterns
float structuring_score = ggml_financial_detect_structuring(system, business);
float layering_score = ggml_financial_detect_layering(system, shell);

// Run anomaly detection
ggml_financial_detect_anomalies(system, ctx);
```

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Account Similarity Analysis
The system computes cosine similarity between account embeddings to find accounts with similar behavior patterns. This enables:
- Clustering of similar account types
- Detection of accounts mimicking legitimate patterns
- Identification of coordinated account networks

### 2. Pattern Recognition

**Structuring Detection**: Identifies accounts breaking large transactions into smaller amounts to avoid reporting thresholds.

**Layering Detection**: Recognizes rapid money movement through multiple accounts to obscure transaction trails.

**Money Laundering Trees**: Uses Matula-Goebel encoding to represent transaction flows as tree structures, enabling mathematical analysis of complex laundering schemes.

### 3. Anomaly Detection
- K-means clustering to establish normal behavior baselines
- Distance-based anomaly scoring in tensor space  
- Automatic flagging of accounts exceeding anomaly thresholds
- Real-time risk assessment

### 4. Transaction Flow Analysis
- 3D relationship tensors [Account × Account × Time] capture transaction patterns
- Temporal flow analysis reveals time-based patterns
- Network analysis identifies hub accounts and flow concentrations

## Mathematical Foundation

The system leverages the existing Matula-Goebel prime encoding from the cognitive tensor infrastructure. Financial relationships naturally form tree-like structures that map directly to this encoding:

```
Money Laundering Tree:
Source Account (root)
├── Shell Company 1 (branch)  
│   ├── Subsidiary A (leaf)
│   └── Subsidiary B (leaf)
└── Shell Company 2 (branch)
    └── Final Destination (leaf)
```

This maps to parentheses notation `((()())((()))` and can be analyzed using the prime factorization properties of the Matula encoding.

- **`ggml-financial-tensor.c`**: Full implementation with all tensor operations  
- **`test-financial-tensor.c`**: Comprehensive test suite covering all features
- **`financial-tensor-example.c`**: Usage example demonstrating key capabilities

## Performance Characteristics

The tensor-based approach provides several advantages over traditional rule-based systems:

1. **Scalability**: Tensor operations are highly parallelizable and GPU-accelerated
2. **Adaptability**: Learns patterns from data rather than relying on fixed rules
3. **Robustness**: Detects novel patterns that don't match known signatures
4. **Real-time**: Fast similarity searches and pattern matching in tensor space

## Future Extensions

The architecture supports extensions for:
- Multi-bank transaction analysis
- Cross-border flow tracking  
- Cryptocurrency integration
- Real-time streaming transaction processing
- Advanced ML model integration

This implementation demonstrates how financial monitoring can benefit from the same mathematical foundations used in cognitive modeling and neural-symbolic AI.
